  Warnings:

  - Added the required column `Ports` to the `Server` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - The required column `UUID` was added to the `Server` table with a prisma-level default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty. Please add this column as optional, then populate it before making it required.
